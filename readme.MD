* 10-vpc: Terraform script creates multiple resources includes VPC ,Internet Gateway, Subnets in multiple available zones, route tables.

* Creates routes and associate routes to corresponding subnets.

* Peering connection with default VPC

* 20-sg: it uses terraform_aws_security_group module to create security groups required for each resource as shown above.

* Communication between the frontend, backend and database will occur with the help of security groups' ingress rules argument source_security_group_id instead of CIDR blocks

* By specifying the backend security group ID in the database security groupâ€™s ingress rule, only servers in the backend group can access the database, ensuring that no other external IPs or unrelated services can interact with your database.

* Using a CIDR block opens the service to a broader range of IP addresses, including potential external addresses if misconfigured. Security group IDs provide a more focused and controlled access scope.

* 30-bastion: in the above repo, for bastion host, several ingress rules are configured to access all three layers instances on ssh 22 port.

* 40-apps: in this repo, all the ec2 resources are created and provisioned frontend service, backend app, database mysql using anisble server.
